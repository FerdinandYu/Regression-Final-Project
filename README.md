# Regression-Final-Project
Kaggle Challenge: Predicting House Sale Prices

This is the final project of **MAP535: Regression** taught at Ã‰cole Polytechnique. It is originally a famous training competition named *House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques* (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques#) on Kaggle. We are required to accomplish data preprocessing and feature engineering first, then build strong linear regression model and use multiple techniques to improve its performance and validate its effectiveness.
